# Codenames Game Theory Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of the **Codenames** game from a **game theory** perspective, evaluating the performance of different spymaster and guesser profiles. It explores **risk-reward relationships**, **cooperative strategies**, and **Nash equilibrium** in the game.

## Key Features:
- Simulation of Codenames with 5 spymaster and 5 guesser profiles.
- Evaluation of success rates, cooperative strategies, and Nash equilibrium.
- Risk-reward analysis with penalties for guessing the black word.
- Visual progress tracking during simulations.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/BoraAlgan/Game-Theory-Preliminary-Experimentation-Results.git
Install required dependencies manually (for example, spacy and json for NLP and data handling):

Requirements:
   ```bash
pip install spacy
pip install json
```
Results:
Simulated results are stored in simulation_results.txt.

Average scores, success rates, and other statistics are generated for different spymaster and guesser combinations.

Additional Information
While running the simulations, I created an interface that tracks the progress of the simulations, allowing for better monitoring of the process.
