# Refined Codenames Game Theory Simulation

This branch contains the **refined experimentation** phase of the project, expanding the dataset to **100 simulations** per profile. It focuses on validating **Nash equilibrium**, correcting statistical anomalies, and analyzing **risk consistency** with larger samples.

## Key Features:
- Expanded simulation to 100 games per pair (2500 total).
- New visualization scripts for Heatmaps and Risk Analysis.
- Evaluation of statistical convergence and hierarchy correction.
- Visual progress tracking during simulations.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone -b refined-experimentation-results https://github.com/BoraAlgan/Game-Theory-Preliminary-Experimentation-Results.git
Install required dependencies manually.
   
Requirements:
   ```bash
pip install spacy
pip install json
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install pandas
```

Results
Simulated results are stored in simulation_results.txt.

Visual analysis graphs (heatmap.png, risk_analysis_updated.png) are generated by running the analysis script:

   ```bash

python results_analysis.py
```
